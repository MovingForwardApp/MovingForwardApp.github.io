          <h1>sereno.xyz terms of service</h1>
          <h2>Definitions</h2>
          <p>
            The “services” are any software, application, product, or
            service provided by sereno.xyz. Collectively they are also
            referred to as the “network”.
          </p>
          <p>
            “sereno.xyz”, “we”, and “us” refers to sereno.xyz and its
            authorized agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “user”, “you”, and “your” refers to any individual or
            organization which accesses our services.
          </p>

          <h2>Account Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Accounts are only available to users who are 13 years of
            age or older, or the minimum age for accessing internet
            services in their country, whichever is older. You must
            also be a human, accounts registered through automated
            means are not permitted. Accounts utilized by an automated
            process are permitted, so long as the initial account
            registration was manually performed by a human.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for your account, any activity
            performed with it, and the security of your account
            credentials.
          </p>
          <p>
            We require an email address to register an account. This
            email address must be kept up-to-date and we must be able
            to reach you for official communication at this
            address. If we are unable to reach you, your account may
            be terminated.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is your responsibility to ensure that all
            local laws regarding data collection are followed
            (e.g. GDPR).
          </p>

          <h2>Account Limits</h2>

          <p><strong>Free Account:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Max 10 monitors, 5 minute minimum check interval and soft
            limit of 300 email notifications for month (soft limit
            because we currently don't know the fair limit so we will
            learn the usage for to finally establish a definitive
            limits).
          <p>

          <p><strong>Email sending limits:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Right now we don't know a fair limits for email sending so
            all limits are soft, we don't want users to be not
            notified because some email limit is reached. Accounts
            with abusive usage will be notified via email with the
            intention of to find a solution or finally suspend email
            sending for that account.
          <p>

          <p><strong>Bounces and Complains:</strong></p>
          <p>
            In order to maintain the email notification reputation
            healthy, we have a strong policy for bounces and complains
            that consists in:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Each profile has a registry of incidents (bounces
                and/or complaints).
              </li>
              <li>
                Email contact creation requires email validation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any contact bounce or complain will register a profile
                incident.
              </li>
              <li>
                A contact has a maximum limit of 3 bounces before is
                permanetly blocked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Blocked contacts can be deleted. Creating it again
                will require again the email validation and if that
                validation results in an other bounce an additional
                incident registry will be added to the profile.
              </li>

              <li>
                If contact receives a complaint, it will be directly blocked.
              </li>

              <li>
                Profiles with more than 5 incidents in the last 7
                days will be eligible to immedite email sending
                suspension.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Commercial use</h2>
          <p>
            The service is free for personal use, but all commercial
            users must purchase a plan after the initial 14-day trial
            or stop using the service until a plan is purchased. A
            website is considered “commercial” if the primary goal is
            to sell or advertise paid products or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a large amount of grey area between strictly
            ‘personal’ and ‘commercial’; for example selling a service
            as a side-project which provides just a little bit of
            pocket money is ‘commercial’, but also ‘personal’. As a
            rule, things like “pocket-money side-projects” are
            considered personal, especially if they’re open
            source. Just get in touch if you’re unsure and I’ll tell
            you if it’s considered personal.
          </p>

          <h2>Payments</h2>
          <p>
            You are billed immediately for the displayed term. These
            services will be remitted to you at the displayed price,
            which will not change during the payment term. If you
            authorize us to automatically renew your service at the
            end of the term, you will be notified at least 1 week in
            advance of renewal when the price has changed during the
            previous payment term.
          </p>
          <p>
            No refunds are given for partial service or when you
            request your services to be downgraded. In the event that
            your services are downgraded, you are billed the reduced
            price at the start of the next billing term.
          </p>
